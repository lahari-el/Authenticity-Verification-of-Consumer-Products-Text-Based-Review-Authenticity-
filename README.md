# Authenticity-Verification-of-Consumer-Products-Text-Based-Review-Authenticity-
Machine learning project for detecting fake and real product reviews using TF-IDF feature extraction and SVM classification.

This project focuses on detecting the authenticity of consumer products by analyzing text reviews submitted by customers. In e-commerce platforms, fake or misleading reviews can misguide buyers and hide the presence of counterfeit products. The system uses machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as genuine (real) or fake, providing insights into potential counterfeit or unreliable products.
